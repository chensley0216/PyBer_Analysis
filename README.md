# PyBer Rideshare Analysis

<b>Overview of the analysis:</b>

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a weekly summary of fares for rideshare data. The data is organized by city type - urban, suburban, and rural.  

<b>Results:</b>

Based on the data, Rural rideshares have the fewest number of rides, but the highest average rate for rides at $34.62, while Urban has the greatest number of rides and the lowest average rates at $24.53.  Suburban showed an average of $30.97 per ride.  Rural had the fewest number of drivers, with only 537, while Urban reported the highest number at 59,602.

<b>Summary:</b>

After considering the data, business recommendations we could provide would be to encourage more drivers to join in the Rural areas so as to raise the numbers in that city type.  Raising the average fare per driver in the Urban areas would raise the overall cost per ride, which could balance with any loss of revenue in Rural areas.  A third option would be to encourage more use of public transportation in Rural areas so as to raise the average number of rides.
